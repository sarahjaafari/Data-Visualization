# Data-Visualization
This project investigates investment patterns in educational and healthcare infrastructure across Ontario. By analyzing data from the "Ontario Builds: Key Infrastructure Projects" dataset, it seeks to understand how funding is distributed, which regions receive the most investment, and whether investment levels correlate with community characteristics. Through data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis, the study aims to inform evidence-based policy decisions that promote equitable and sustainable infrastructure development. The findings provide insights into how Ontario's infrastructure priorities shape community success, access to essential services, and long-term economic growth.
